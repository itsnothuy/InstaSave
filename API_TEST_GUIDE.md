# 🧪 Instagram API Test Guide

Your environment variables are now set up! Here's how to test your Instagram API integration.

## ✅ **Current Setup**
- **Instagram App ID**: `1705248783525759` ✅
- **Instagram App Secret**: `372210504316f472690d2b3db956ebba` ✅
- **Development Server**: Running with real API credentials
- **Environment Variables**: Loaded correctly

## 🔧 **Before Testing Real API**

### **Important Requirements Check:**

1. **Instagram Account Type** ⚠️
   - Your Instagram account MUST be **Business** or **Creator** (not Personal)
   - Go to Instagram Settings → Account → Switch to Professional Account

2. **Facebook Page Connection** ⚠️  
   - Business Instagram accounts need to be connected to a Facebook Page
   - Go to Instagram Settings → Account → Linked Accounts → Facebook

3. **App Roles** ⚠️
   - In your Meta App Dashboard → App Roles → Roles
   - Add your Instagram username as **Developer** or **Tester**

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Demo Mode** (Works Now)
1. **Open**: http://localhost:3002 (or whichever port is running)
2. **Enter any Instagram URL**: `https://www.instagram.com/p/XXXXXXXXX/`
3. **Click Download** - Should show demo data with download options
4. **✅ Expected**: Demo content with multiple quality options

### **Step 2: Test Real API Mode** (Requires setup above)
1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3002/private
2. **Click "Connect Instagram Account"**
3. **OAuth Flow**: Should redirect to Instagram login
4. **Grant Permissions**: Allow access to your media
5. **✅ Expected**: Redirect back with success message

### **Step 3: Test User Media** (After OAuth)
1. **After successful OAuth**: Should see your Instagram content
2. **Click on any media item**: Shows real download options
3. **✅ Expected**: Your actual Instagram posts with download links

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **❌ "No Instagram Business Account found"**
**Solution**: 
- Switch your Instagram to Business/Creator account
- Connect to a Facebook Page
- Wait 10-15 minutes for Meta to sync

### **❌ "OAuth error" or "Access denied"**
**Solution**:
- Add your Instagram username to App Roles in Meta Dashboard
- Ensure you're using a Professional Instagram account
- Check OAuth redirect URIs match exactly

### **❌ "Rate limit exceeded"**
**Solution**:
- Instagram APIs have hourly limits during development
- Wait 1 hour or use a different test account

### **❌ "App not found" or "Invalid credentials"**
**Solution**:
- Double-check your App ID and Secret in `.env.local`
- Ensure you're using the Instagram product credentials (not Facebook)

## 🎯 **What Each Mode Tests**

### **Demo Mode** (Always Works)
